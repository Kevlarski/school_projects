<p>My name is Kevin McLaughlin. I'm taking this class in my Software Engineering path at OCC. I'm a huge fan of games, but I prefer boad games to video games. I also love Red Wings hockey and Michigan football. I play disc golf when the weather allows, which will hopefully be a lot more now that the weather is nicer!</p>
